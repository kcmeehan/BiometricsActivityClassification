Things to do:

- Download the activity database http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring
- Take a look at the data. Try making plots etc. 
- Think about what features we might want to extract.
- Read up about feature engineering

Questions:

- What sort of data is being recorded? Are there missing data?
- Is the data labelled?
- What is the size of the database? Can it all be loaded into memory? Might need to put everything into a single 
database before we even start.

Points from 1st meeting (07/25/2018)

- Remove 10 seconds of data from the beginning and end of each activity (or maybe it doesn't have to be be 10 seconds)
- Be sure to exclude activity 0 from any analysis
- Make a lookup table for the activities
- Note the heart rate normalization: Need to determine the resting and maximum heartrate of each subject in order to do this. The maximum heartrate is determined by the age of the subject. MHR = 220 - age.

Action points from Reiss (2012) paper
Find out what LOSO 9-fold cross validatition is vs. regular cross validation
Look into their preformance measures 
Read Reiss (2011)a,b 

### 

Need to think about the classification problem that we're actually going to do - individial classification or some sort of 
grouping of the features in classification 

Feature ideas:
- Correlation between axes 
- Correlation between different accelerometers
- Peak frequency of PSD 
- Spectral entropy of normalized PSD 
- Synchronized data from all three sensors in weighted sum, pairwise and in total 
- Mean, standard deviation, integral and energy 

###

Features that were previously used (Reiss 2011(a,b) & 2012)

Time domain:
- mean, median, standard deviation, peak acceleration, absolute integral 

Frequency domain: 
- Peak frequency in the PSD, power ratio in the bands 0-2.5Hz and 0-5Hz, energy of the frequency band 0-10Hz, energy of the normalized PSD in the band 0-10Hz
- Correlation between channels 
- Weighted sum across three channels

###

TO DO:

-> Write code to calculate features! Maybe get inspiration from the tsfresh package here. Once the features are calulated they need to populate a new 'feature' dataframe, which can then be fed to the classifier
-> Look into what features we might want to use - maybe do some more exploratory plotting to see what features change dramatically between activities
-> Think about which classifiers we want to use.
